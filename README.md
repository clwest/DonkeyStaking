This project is a combination of @Patrick Collins and @Curve 

The goal of this project is to build out a walk through that I can redo while recording and explaining what is going on 
Before starting over I need to add the following

1. Connect all of the backend so that users can stake donkey tonkens into curve and earn rewards
2. Build out the front end
3. Add contracts to interact with AAVE
4. Once starting over continue to build out this project while making and writing about it
5.
